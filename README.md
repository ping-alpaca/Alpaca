# K_Means

## Usage

To use the functions in this package, import k_means from k_means.py.
You can pass this function a list of tuples (where each tuple represents)
a 2-D point in the plane, and a k value (number of clusters) to obtain

1.) A dictionary that maps each point to a cluster id (in [0, k - 1])
2.) A dictionary that maps a cluster id to a centroid location in the plane.

To run a set of basic unit tests, run 'python3 test.py'
